                  <p> Close up magic is a show done in close proximity of the guests.
                    My close-up show takes takes place in the spectatorâ€™s very own hands. I use the art called prestidigitation,
                    which is the highest and hardest form of magic and you can experience it first hand.
                  </p>

                    I am able to perform this show for several hours, without repeating material. As I mingle amongst your guests, I will perform miracles for them in small groups.
